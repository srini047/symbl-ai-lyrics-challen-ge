I had enough of you
I can't get enough of you
Said I had enough of you
I just can't get enough of you
You said I'd be alright but every song I write you stay up in my head
With every sunset I can't forget the days you stayed in my bed
We used to lay up past midnight, day after day you stayed at my house
We were just passing time
Me and you, no one else
You were my RiRi, it was never meant to be-be
If it never worked for us, it was never meant to work for us
I had the worst luck with my first love
Worst luck with my first love
Ridin' shotty with my shawty
Bumpin' Alicia with my shikorina
We had so much in common, sweet up from the head top to the foot bottom
Used to lick on my head top while I licked on your foot bottoms
Then I bust on your butt, yeah bust on your bottom
Is this love? Is this love? Is this love?
Felt like real love cause we'd fuck with no condoms
Girl, I'll be alright, but you been running through my mind
You been on my mind all day, running through my mind all day
Girl, I'll be alright but you been running through my mind
You been on my mind all day, running through my mind all day
But girl, I'm feeling fine
You call, I decline
I just want what's mine and more
Only pick up to fuck up your spinal cord
Follow on, you were the right girl that was wrong
Wasn't there when you were there, didn't care when you cared
My pineapple crush crushed me
Trust me, I'ma leave your heart shattered
What's up with your fat friend? She sour
Only time I lied when I told you your ass was getting fatter
I been drinking, fucking up my bladder
Thinking 'bout the times that I had her
When I used to beat it up like batter
Ain't no bitch badder
I had enough of you
I can't get enough of you (can't get enough, can't get enough)
Said I had enough of you
I just can't get enough of you (can't get enough, can't get enough)
Girl, I'll be alright but you been running through my mind
You been on my mind all day, running through my mind all day
Girl, I'll be alright but you been running through my mind
You been on my mind all day, running through my mind all day
Said she don't wanna break no hearts, I'm a rock star baby girl
Fuck with me I'll break your heart baby
From the start baby, should've known from the start baby
I'm a rockstar
